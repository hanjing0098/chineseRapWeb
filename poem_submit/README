[0] INTRODUCTION

This is the submission from USC/ISI for Dartmouth PoetiX Turing Test competition.
Our system is called Hafez. Given a topic, It will generate fourteen line poems,
in iambic pentameter and in "Shakesperean" form.

Credit goes to Marjan Ghazvininejad, Xing Shi, Yejin Choi and Kevin Knight. 

An online demo for our system can be found at: 

http://52.24.230.241/poem/

[1] SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
 
    OS: Ubuntu Linux 14.04
    Python Version: 2.7

[2] INSTALLATION AND RUN

To generate a poem about "home", type:

$ python RunMe.py home

To generate a poem about topic "civil war", type:

$ python RunMe.py civil war

The Program will print the poem into STDOUT.
Here is one example: 

$ python RunMe.py civil war
The silver candle may forever cuddle.
A river flowing under water icing,
An endless autumn summer winter struggle,
Upon an early morning Easter rising.

And mother nature never took control.
Or ever think of foreign intervention,
Or maybe any other mortal soul,
A human body offers no attention.

And not the only one victorious,
Protected from another civil war.
An ancient evening old and glorious,
Perhaps a hundred thousand years or more.

Become an angel by the name of Henry,
Sing a song about the king of Gentry.

Each time you call RunMe.py with a specific topic, it will
generate a different poem about that topic. So to generate an
unlimited number of original sonnets about certain topic, just
run RunMe.py with that topic unlimited times. 

The estimated time to generate a poem is around 50 seconds on
a 16 GB RAM, 16 core machine.
